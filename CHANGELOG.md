## 1.1.0 (2016-05-28)

Breaking Change:

- The `pageScrollFinish` event is now called for interrupted/interfered page 
scroll animations as well. A boolean is emitted, indicating whether the 
animation got interrupted.

Feature:

- The new property `pageScrollInterruptible` allows setting whether a 
triggered scroll animation should be interrutible or not. A page wide 
default can be specified using `PageScrollConfig.defaultInterruptible`.

Fix:

- Only register event listeners for running page scroll animations to 
save resources (fixes #9)
- Overshooting target when large distance to scroll and short scroll animation 
duration (fixes #7)
- body.scrollTop not working on non-Blink based browser like Firefox and IE 
(thanks to [bensgroi](https://github.com/bensgroi), #10)
 
Other:

- Running animations are stopped when pressing a pageScroll link, even if the 
scroll target is not found or already reached (previously it did not stop).
